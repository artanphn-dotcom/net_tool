# Network Engineer Toolbox

A frontend-only, serverless web-based toolbox for network engineers. All tools run entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, hosted on static platforms like GitHub Pages.

## Features

This toolbox provides a collection of essential networking utilities without requiring any backend services.

### Current Tools
- **DNS Lookup:** Perform DNS queries for various record types (A, AAAA, TXT, MX, NS, CNAME) using the Cloudflare DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) public resolver.

### Planned Tools
- IP & Subnet Calculators (CIDR, VLSM)
- Security Tools (SSL Certificate Checks)
- Cloud & BGP Utilities (ASN Lookups)
- HTTPS Latency Testing
- And more...

## How to Use

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
3.  No installation or build steps are required.

## Technology Stack

-   **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
-   **UI:** Bootstrap 5 for a clean, responsive, and professional interface.
-   **APIs:** All tools rely on free and public APIs (e.g., Cloudflare DoH).

## Principles

-   **No Backend:** 100% static and client-side.
-   **Secure:** No user data is stored or sent to any server, other than the necessary calls to public APIs.
-   **Easy to Host:** Can be deployed on any static web hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).
-   **Portfolio Quality:** Clean, modular, and well-documented code.
